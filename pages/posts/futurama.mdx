## So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?

But existing is basically all I do! Shut up and get to the point! Meh. Ow, my spirit! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

I'm a thing. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Why did you bring us here? **Tell her she looks thin.** _Meh._ We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

## Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.

Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

1. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!
2. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?
3. Anyone who laughs is a communist!

### It's a T. It goes "tuh".

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

- Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
- Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.
- Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?

Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Leela's gonna kill me. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.

I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.

One hundred dollars. They're like sex, except I'm having them! Say what? Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Bender?! You stole the atom. It's toe-tappingly tragic!

You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.

Tell her she looks thin. Professor, make a woman out of me. With gusto. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Soon enough. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Large bet on myself in round one. Soothe us with sweet lies. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.

Can I use the gun? There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.

Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. But existing is basically all I do! Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!
