## How it started

I got some confidence in my React frontend skills, made a resume and started applying 2 months ago, and got a position for software engineering in an IT Consultant company called OKANEMO, well, they gave me a test which is a ruby on rails test, to handle an API and save it to database, i passed the test, go to the interview and got offered.

## My first week

In the day before my first day (I got a high fever btw ðŸ¤’), i started learning Laravel, just in one day, from a youtube called _web programming unpas_ i grasped the concept really quickly there, and in my first day i was told to do some dynamic JSON-LD, so i did, i learned how to put variables a in blade template and made the JSON-LD dynamically per page, i successfully pushed that code and merge it, and later in the week, i was told to do some _database migration_ in laravel, i was told to add a column there.

I also learned about _branching model_ in Git.

## My second week

### Bootstrap

In the second week, the CEO decided to revamp the whole website and copy a site called SIMONAS, so in this week i do a lot of frontend, i use bootstrap for this, at the first time, i was slow and had to read documentation every 5 minutes, but in like 3 days, i can do bootstrap really quickly and can _eye_ the design without even reading the documentation.

So I did like 7 pages of frontend in that week, i do 4 pages in friday, the CEO is impressed on how fast i am in frontend and impressed that i had a clean code & had a clear pull request comment, i even added GIF to scroll on the page that i created, he said it's the first time my worker goes that extra miles.

btw i also did some SICK emmet shortcut when cloning the simonas site

### First Video Meeting

In friday, we do a meeting with cameras for the first time.

The CEO is the one with a messed up camera and a baggy T-shirt i was like what? this is not formal, i'm the only one with a collared shirt, and this meeting is kinda sketchy, the CEO talks about how he's a simple man, and doesn't have any money, i really think this is some kind of _propaganda_ for the worker so that they don't expect a high salary or even get paid at all.

### Worry about work-life balance.

Because of ramadhan, the meeting is set to 9:30 PM GMT+7, well i'm in GMT+8 timezone and the meeting is on 10:30, so i have to do a meeting for like 10.30 PM to 11.00 PM every work day and i came home from my prayers in 10 PM so i already tired, this is not _balanced_ at all, and not healthy for me.

And this is what my contract said, it supposed to end in 18.00

Here's what the company description like ðŸ¤£

## My Third week

After I did a bunch of frontend last week (I did 7 pixel perfect clone pages), I was told to do some backend too.

> These guys really disrespect and look down on _frontend_ developers, and glorify how they can't design a website or application, the fact that you can't do design doesn't make you a great _backend_ developer.

### Basic Laravel CRUD

So I created a user list dashboard, which is a CRUD pages essentially, i learned this in my first day when i watched _web programming unpas._ [[Laravel#Daftar mahasiswa]]

### SQL Commands

I do some SQL in the command line (using docker)

### Overworked.

![](https://i.imgur.com/d3ay1z6.png)

So i was doing a page to edit a profile, it has many data and the data has many relations, so i had to learn SQL relations in laravel, and i did the frontend aswell, this took 12 hours and i felt really burnout.

It affects my college life too, i started to turned my assignment late.

I was told to re-do my whole page front-end last week which i did 12 hours on, it clones _Tech in Asia_ now.

And i did some tricky page with Bootstrap Navs, it do some dynamic page change without any frameworks.

![](https://i.imgur.com/3oIWOdU.gif)

In my pull request, i have some thorough documentation just like my any other PR's.

![](https://i.imgur.com/kjDIU5h.png)

All i get was a "Good job", i was naive to think that this is enough.

## Fifth week

In the fifth week i was doing this page

![](https://i.imgur.com/Rj0LpzC.png)

And adjust a width in the entire page (changed `container px-5` to `container px-3`) to match glints.

### Team started leaving.

In this week, 2 of the intern that the CEO had good laugh with in every meeting, no longer work in the company, the CEO said the first one quits because of a hectic college life in Japan, he didn't mention the second one, so after a while i asked him why, then he rambles about for 30 minute on how _shitty_ that intern is and straight up fires him, i was like what? ðŸ˜• aren't you suppose to teach the interns when they made a mistake and not just fire him on that day? it's not even a major mistake too, and can easily be fixed.

In that meeting i was thinking about getting another internship the whole time, so the next day i decided to stand up for myself and asked the CEO about compensation for all my work output these past month (I was thinking to stay if he actually compensate) **he avoided that topic**. ^822e4b

## Had enough.

It's been like more than one month and i don't get any compensation for my work output and the damages to my mental health, I started to learn Next.js this time, changed my status to _open to work_, and hopes i got a javascript job that i actually like.
